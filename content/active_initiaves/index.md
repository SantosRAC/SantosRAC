## Julia code clubs (started in November, 2021)

 * **Where?** On Google Meet
 * **When?** On Wednesdays at 11:30 am (BRT)
 * **How long do we stay online?** We meet for an hour every week!
 * **How can I join the group?** Just [message me](/contact/)!

## Research Topic in Frontiers in (Bioinformatics and Education)

 * [Original Strategies for Training and Educational Initiatives in Bioinformatics](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/17876/original-strategies-for-training-and-educational-initiatives-in-bioinformatics). Although I wrote the proposal and coordinated the team of editors, I was not eligible to be an actual editor because I hadn't graduated at the time (~ Oct/2020).

## Computational Thinking (High School)

 ## Bioinfo Meetings no CCA

 * Active meetings to discuss bioinformatics, science communication (in bioinformatics), coding (for bioinformatics), and bioinformatics in high school. Check out [our repository](https://github.com/SantosRAC/BioinfoMeetingsCCA) (in Portuguese)
