## Julia code clubs (started in November, 2021)

 * **Where?** On Google Meet
 * **When?** On Tuesdays at 5pm (BRT)
 * **How long do we stay online?** We meet for an hour every week!
 * **How can I join the group?** Just [message me](/contact/)!

## Research Topic in Frontiers in (Bioinformatics and Education)

 * [Original Strategies for Training and Educational Initiatives in Bioinformatics](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/17876/original-strategies-for-training-and-educational-initiatives-in-bioinformatics). Although I wrote the proposal and coordinated the team of editors, I was not eligible to be an actual editor because I hadn't graduated at the time (~ Oct/2020).

## Computational Thinking (High School)

 * UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data (2022 edition)

 * Site under construction (see [our page in 2021](https://btwbd.gitlab.io/sitepythonbiodata2021/))

## Python Workshop for Microbiology Data (2022 edition)

 * Site under construction (see [our page in 2021](https://python-for-microbiology-data-brazil.gitlab.io/sitepythonmicrobiodata2021/))

 ## Bioinfo Meetings no CCA

 * Active meetings to discuss bioinformatics, science communication (in bioinformatics), coding (for bioinformatics), and bioinformatics in high school. Check out [our repository](https://github.com/SantosRAC/BioinfoMeetingsCCA) (in Portuguese)
 * We are currently developing an application using Flask and MySQL. During and after deployment, the main objetives of this project are:
    * To organize information related to activities of our group
    * To get involvement of computer science students in activities involving:
      * Database management
      * SQL
      * Web development
      * Object-oriented programming (ORM)
      * Cloud Computing (e.g., AWS)
